However, it is important to understand that we are not moving away from \ndnsmasq\n, but, in contrast, are coupling even closer to it by incorporating it into \nFTL\n. This provides us with a much more reliable monolith \nDNS\n solution where we can be sure that the versions of \nFTL\n and the \nDNS\n internals are always 100% compatible with each other.\n\n\nAs we maintain our own fork of \ndnsmasq\n we have been able to apply some \nminimal\n changes to the source code which might bring substantial benefits for our users. However, although the potential for changes is endless, we want to include as few modifications as possible. As a purely volunteer driven project, you will surely understand that it was already a major undertaking to get \nFTL\nDNS\n set up and running. It was much more than just copy-pasting \ndnsmasq\n into place.\n\n\nWe have always been very explicit about how we will react to feature requests that target the resolver part (from the initial \nFTL\nDNS\n beta test announcement):\n\n\n\n\nThink of \nFTL\nDNS\n as \ndnsmasq\n with Pi-hole\u2019s special sauce. This allows us to easily merge any upstream changes that get added, while still allowing us to continue to develop Pi-hole as we have been.\n\n\n\n\nIf we would start to modify the resolver code in too many places, then this would probably make us deviate too much from \ndnsmasq\n's code base and we couldn't apply patches easily preventing us from being able to ship important security updates.\n\n\nImplemented modifications in \ndnsmasq\n's source code\n\n\nFTL\n hooks\n\n\nWe place hooks in a lot of places in the resolver that branch out into \nFTL\n code to process queries and responses. By this, we keep the resolver code itself clean.\n\n\nRemove limit on maximum cache size\n\n\nUsers are able to configure the size of the resolvers name cache. The default is 150 names. Setting the cache size to zero disables caching. We think users should be allowed to set the cache size to any value they find appropriate. However, \ndnsmasq\n's source code contains a condition that limits the maximum size of the cache to 10,000 names. We removed this hard-coded upper limit in \noption.c\n and submitted a patch to remove this hard-coded limit in the upstream version of \ndnsmasq\n.\n\n\nImprove detection algorithm for determining the \"best\" forward destination\n\n\nThe \nDNS\n forward destination determination algorithm in \nFTL\nDNS\n's is modified to be much less restrictive than the original algorithm in \ndnsmasq\n. We keep using the fastest responding server now for 1000 queries or 10 minutes (whatever happens earlier) instead of 50 queries or 10 seconds (default values in \ndnsmasq\n).\nWe keep the exceptions, i.e., we try all possible forward destinations if \nSERVFAIL\n or \nREFUSED\n is received or if a timeout occurs.\nOverall, this change has proven to greatly reduce the number of actually performed queries in typical Pi-hole environments. It may even be understood as being preferential in terms of privacy (as we send queries much less often to all servers).\nThis has been implemented in commit \nd1c163e\n on the \nFTLDNS\n branch.",

This may come in handy if you are designing blocking rules (see also our cheat sheet below!). In our implementation, all characters match themselves except for the following special characters: \n.[{}()\\*+?|^$\n. If you want to match those, you need to escape them like \n\\.\n for a literal period, but no rule without exception (see character groups below for further details).\n\n\nAnchors (\n^\n and \n$\n)\n\n\nFirst of all, we look at anchors which can be used to indicate the start or the end of a domain, respectively.

SQLite implements most of the SQL-92 standard for SQL and can be used for high-level queries.\n\n\nWe update the database file periodically and on exit of \nFTL\nDNS\n (triggered e.g. by a \nservice pihole-FTL restart\n). The updating frequency can be controlled by the parameter \nDBINTERVAL\n and defaults to once per minute. We think this interval is sufficient to protect against data losses due to power failure events. \nFTL\nDNS\n needs the database to populate its internal history of the most recent 24 hours. If the database is disabled, \nFTL\nDNS\n will show an empty query history after a restart.\n\n\nThe location of the database can be configures by the config parameter \nDBFILE\n. It defaults to \n/etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db\n. If the given file does not exist, \nFTL\nDNS\n will create a new (empty) database file.\n\n\nYou can split your long-term database by periodically rotating the database file (do this only when \npihole-FTL\n is \nnot\n running). The individual database contents can easily be merged when required.\nThis could be implemented by running a monthly \ncron\n job such as:\n\nsudo service pihole-FTL stop\nsudo mv /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db /media/backup/pihole-FTL_$(date +\n%m-%y\n).db\nsudo service pihole-FTL start\n\n\nNote that \nDNS\n resolution will not be available as long as \npihole-FTL\n is stopped.\n\n\nAnother way of controlling the size of the long-term database is setting a maximum age for log queries to keep using the config parameter \nMAXDBDAYS\n. It defaults to 365 days, i.e. queries that are older than one year get periodically removed to limit the growth of the long-term database file.\n\n\n\n\nThe long-term database contains three tables:\n\n\nQuery Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel\n\n\nType\n\n\nAllowed to by empty\n\n\nContent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nNo\n\n\nautoincrement \nID\n for the table, only used by \nSQLite3\n, not by \nFTL\nDNS\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nNo\n\n\nUnix timestamp when this query arrived at \nFTL\nDNS\n (used as index)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nNo\n\n\nType of this query (see \nSupported query types\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nNo\n\n\nHow was this query handled by \nFTL\nDNS\n?

            "text": "The problem: Whom can you trust?\n\n\nPi-hole includes a caching and \nforwarding\n DNS server, now known as \nFTL\nDNS. After applying the blocking lists, it forwards requests made by the clients to configured upstream DNS server(s). However, as has been mentioned by several users in the past, this leads to some privacy concerns as it ultimately raises the question: \nWhom can you trust?\n Recently, more and more small (and not so small) DNS upstream providers have appeared on the market, advertising free and private DNS service, but how can you know that they keep their promises? Right, you can't.\n\n\nFurthermore, from the point of an attacker, the DNS servers of larger providers are very worthwhile targets, as they only need to poison one DNS server, but millions of users might be affected. Instead of your bank's actual IP address, you could be sent to a phishing site hosted on some island. This scenario has \nalready happened\n and it isn't unlikely to happen again...\n\n\nWhen you operate your own (tiny) recursive DNS server, then the likeliness of getting affected by such an attack is greatly reduced.\n\n\nWhat \nis\n a recursive DNS server?\n\n\nThe first distinction we have to be aware of is whether a DNS server is \nauthoritative\n or not.  If I'm the authoritative server for, e.g., \npi-hole.net\n, then I know which IP is the correct answer for a query. Recursive name servers, in contrast, resolve any query they receive by consulting the servers authoritative for this query by traversing the domain.\nExample: We want to resolve \npi-hole.net\n. On behalf of the client, the recursive DNS server will traverse the path of the domain across the Internet to deliver the answer to the question.\n\n\nWhat does this guide provide?\n\n\nIn only a few simple steps, we will describe how to set up your own recursive DNS server. It will run on the same device you're already using for your Pi-hole. There are no additional hardware requirements.\n\n\nThis guide assumes a fairly recent Debian/Ubuntu based system and will use the maintainer provided packages for installation to make it an incredibly simple process. It assumes only very basic knowledge of how DNS works.\n\n\nA \nstandard\n Pi-hole installation will do it as follows:\n\n\n\n\nYour client asks the Pi-hole \nWho is pi-hole.net\n?\n\n\nYour Pi-hole will check its cache and reply if the answer is already known.\n\n\nYour Pi-hole will check the blocking lists and reply if the domain is blocked.\n\n\nSince neither 2. nor 3. is true in our example, the Pi-hole forwards the request to the configured \nexternal\n upstream DNS server(s).\n\n\nUpon receiving the answer, your Pi-hole will reply to your client and tell it the answer of its request.\n\n\nLastly, your Pi-hole will save the answer in its cache to be able to respond faster if \nany\n of your clients queries the same domain again.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you set up your Pi-hole as described in this guide, this procedure changes notably:\n\n\n\n\nYour client asks the Pi-hole \nWho is pi-hole.net\n?\n\n\nYour Pi-hole will check its cache and reply if the answer is already known.\n\n\nYour Pi-hole will check the blocking lists and reply if the domain is blocked.\n\n\nSince neither 2. nor 3. is true in our example, the Pi-hole delegates the request to the (local) recursive DNS resolver.\n\n\nYour recursive server will send a query to the DNS root servers: \"Who is handling \n.net\n?\"\n\n\nThe root server answers with a referral to the TLD servers for \n.net\n.\n\n\nYour recursive server will send a query to one of the TLD DNS servers for \n.net\n: \"Who is handling \npi-hole.net\n?\"\n\n\nThe TLD server answers with a referral to the authoritative name servers for \npi-hole.net\n.\n\n\nYour recursive server will send a query to the authoritative name servers: \"What is the IP of \npi-hole.net\n?\"\n\n\nThe authoritative server will answer with the IP address of the domain \npi-hole.net\n.\n\n\nYour recursive server will send the reply to your Pi-hole which will, in turn, reply to your client and tell it the answer of its request.\n\n\nLastly, your Pi-hole will save the answer in its cache to be able to respond faster if \nany\n of your clients queries the same domain again.\n\n\n\n\nYou can easily imagine even longer chains for subdomains as the query process continues until your recursive resolver reaches the authoritative server for the zone that contains the queried domain name. It is obvious that the methods are very different and the own recursion is more involved than \"just\" asking some upstream server. This has benefits and drawbacks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit: Privacy - as you're directly contacting the responsive servers, no server can fully log the exact paths you're going, as e.g. the Google DNS servers will only be asked if you want to visit a Google website, but not if you visit the website of your favorite newspaper, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawback: Traversing the path may be slow, especially for the first time you visit a website - while the bigger DNS providers always have answers for commonly used domains in their cache, you will have to transverse the path if you visit a page for the first time time. A first request to a formerly unknown TLD may take up to a second (or even more if you're also using DNSSEC). Subsequent requests to domains under the same TLD usually complete in \n 0.1s\n.\nFortunately, both your Pi-hole as well as your recursive server will be configured for efficient caching to minimize the number of queries that will actually have to be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Pi-hole as a recursive DNS server solution\n\n\nWe will use \nunbound\n, a secure open source recursive DNS server primarily developed by NLnet Labs, VeriSign Inc., Nominet, and Kirei.\nThe first thing you need to do is to install the recursive DNS resolver:\n\nsudo apt install unbound\n\n\n\nOptional: Download the list of primary root servers (serving the domain \n.\n).

This has benefits and drawbacks:    Benefit: Privacy - as you're directly contacting the responsive servers, no server can fully log the exact paths you're going, as e.g. the Google DNS servers will only be asked if you want to visit a Google website, but not if you visit the website of your favorite newspaper, etc.    Drawback: Traversing the path may be slow, especially for the first time you visit a website - while the bigger DNS providers always have answers for commonly used domains in their cache, you will have to transverse the path if you visit a page for the first time time. A first request to a formerly unknown TLD may take up to a second (or even more if you're also using DNSSEC). Subsequent requests to domains under the same TLD usually complete in   0.1s .\nFortunately, both your Pi-hole as well as your recursive server will be configured for efficient caching to minimize the number of queries that will actually have to be performed.",

This section is aimed at a server setup in a private network like on a Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nSo if blocking works using \neth0\n but stops working for \ntun0\n, as described \nhere\n, you may want to run this command \npihole -a -i all\n, which should get the behaviour you want by opening dnsmasq up to listen on all ports. This is not recommended for cloud servers as they should \nnot\n be listening on \neth0\n.\n\n\nIf you want to set up your Pi-hole + OpenVPN such that you can use from both internal ((W)LAN) and external (VPN) networks, you have to apply some small changes. As additional benefit, you will be able to reach all devices in the internal network (e.g. computers, networking-aware printers, etc.) through the VPN.\n\n\nThis setup assumes that your local network is in the range \n192.168.2.0\n (i.e. device addresses are in the range of 192.168.2.1 - 192.168.2.254). If this is not the case for you, you have to adjust the settings, accordingly, e.g.\n\n\n\n\ndevices in 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.254 -\n \nroute 192.168.0.0\n\n\ndevices in 192.168.123.1 - 192.168.123.254 -\n \nroute 192.168.123.0\n\n\n\n\nEdit your \n/etc/openvpn/server.conf\n:\n\n\npush \nroute 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0\n\npush \ndhcp-option DNS \nb\n192.168.2.123\n/b\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we change the address of the DNS server to the local IP address of our Pi-hole (which is \n192.168.2.123\n in this example).\n\n\nAfterwards, we change the interface of \nPi-hole\n to \neth0\n (your local network adapter instead of the VPN adapter \ntun0\n). This can conveniently be done by using \npihole -r\n + \nReconfigure\n.\n\n\nAfter a restart of the OpenVPN server, all clients should be able to see all devices within your (at home) local network. This is an example running on a distant server, which is connected through the VPN and can successfully communicate with all internal devices:\n\n\nme@client ~ $ ifconfig\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr e0:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  \n          inet addr:134.x.x.x  Bcast:134.x.x.x  Mask:255.x.x.x\n          inet6 addr: X:X:X:X::X/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:3623911 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:2803670 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:1921375471 (1.9 GB)  TX bytes:1227835028 (1.2 GB)\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:553426 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:553426 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1 \n          RX bytes:113417383 (113.4 MB)  TX bytes:113417383 (113.4 MB)\n\ntun0      Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  \n          inet addr:10.8.0.2  P-t-P:10.8.0.2  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:274676 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:331178 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:100 \n          RX bytes:43745313 (43.7 MB)  TX bytes:43956250 (43.9 MB)\n\nme@client ~ $ ping 192.168.2.123\nPING 192.168.2.123 (192.168.2.123) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.123: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=18.9 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.123: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=18.9 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.123: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=18.9 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.123: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=18.7 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.123: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=18.7 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.2.123: icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=19.0 ms\n^C\n--- 192.168.2.123 ping statistics ---\n6 packets transmitted, 6 received, 0% packet loss, time 5007ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 18.740/18.894/19.017/0.189 ms\n\n\n\n\nImportant last step\n\n\nThe undocumented \npihole -a -i all\n command is simply what runs when you choose \nListen on all interfaces, permit all origins (make sure your Pi-hole is firewalled)\n, which if you've read this far in the tutorial, you should understand that we don't want you to knowingly or unknowing set up an open resolver.",
